## Technical Architecture & Database Design

The foundation for EasyShopping's performance, scalability, and maintainability.

### Frontend Architecture (**React/ViteJS**)

The frontend will use **React** for its component-based structure, enabling modular and reusable UI elements (e.g., product cards, shopping carts). **React's Virtual DOM** ensures efficient updates for real-time changes. **ViteJS** will accelerate development and improve maintainability. The architecture will support a **mobile-first workflow** and follow established patterns for clear separation of components, pages, services, and styles.

### Backend Architecture (**RESTful API**)

A **RESTful API** will decouple frontend and backend development, allowing independent feature releases. It will support **standard CRUD operations** with automatic pagination, depth, and sorting, and allow custom endpoints for specific business logic. **Security is paramount**: API endpoints will require valid access tokens for authentication, and proper CORS headers will be set for secure communication. The backend will focus on **data processing, server communication, and scalable data storage/retrieval**.

### Relational Database Schema

A well-structured relational database is crucial for efficient transaction management and data integrity. Key entities and their relationships include:

| **Entity** | **Key Attributes** | **Relationships** |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------------|
| **Product** | ProductID (PK), Name, Description, Price, QuantityAvailable | Many-to-One with Category |
| **Customer** | CustomerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Email, Address, ContactNumber | One-to-Many with Order, One-to-Many with Payment |
| **Order** | OrderID (PK), CustomerID (FK), OrderDate, TotalAmount | One-to-Many with OrderItem, One-to-One with Payment |
| **OrderItem** | OrderItemID (PK), OrderID (FK), ProductID (FK), Quantity, Price | Many-to-One with Order, Many-to-One with Product |
| **Category** | CategoryID (PK), Name, Picture, Description | One-to-Many with Product |
| **Payment** | PaymentID (PK), Type, Amount | One-to-One with Order, Many-to-One with Customer |

This structured approach ensures **data integrity**, supports **seamless transactions**, and enables **efficient data retrieval** for business operations and reporting.

## Prioritization Framework & Project Success Considerations

Successful delivery relies on disciplined prioritization and a holistic view of project success.

### Prioritization Criteria

Tickets will be prioritized based on a balanced assessment of:
* **Business Value:** Direct contribution to objectives like conversion rates, customer satisfaction, or administrative efficiency.
* **Technical Effort:** Estimated time and resources; smaller, high-value tasks offer quicker wins.
* **Dependencies:** Prerequisites for other significant functionalities.
* **Risk:** Technical complexity or uncertainty; breaking down complex tasks.

### Agile Methodology & User Stories

Adopting an **agile methodology** (e.g., Scrum/Kanban) and using **user stories** will ensure iterative development and continuous feedback. User stories, in the "As a [persona], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]" format, keep the focus on **delivering tangible value to the end-user**, fostering collaboration and maintaining team momentum.

### Security & Performance

**Security and performance are non-negotiable** from the outset.
* **Security:** SSL encryption, robust authentication/authorization, regular audits, and protection against threats like SQL injection.
* **Performance:** Image optimization (resizing, lazy loading), CDNs, fast SSD hosting, scalable architecture, optimized database management, and responsive design for all devices.
